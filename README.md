# C++

C++ is a flexible and powerful programming language that works equally well on multiple operating systems (such as Linux, Apple Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, and more).

# Compiler

A compiler is what converts C++ programs so that they can run. The compiler translates a program from a human-readable form called **source code** into a *machine-runnable* form called **machine code**.

# Programming Environments

Some of these are GCC (the GNU Compiler Collection), Microsoft Visual Studio, and Netbeans.

# How *Compiling* Works ?

C++ programs begin as source code, which means that they are written inside of  simple code editors in the form of *plain text*.

Source code files that you will create will different extensions.
